        <h2>TurboTurtle Coin Whitepaper</h2>
        <div class="whitepaper">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>TurboTurtle Coin is a community-driven meme cryptocurrency designed to bring fun, excitement, and value to the crypto space. TurboTurtle is inspired by the humor, creativity, and culture of meme coins, and aims to create a thriving ecosystem where the community plays an active role in driving its success. Unlike other meme coins, TurboTurtle embraces the values of decentralization, transparency, and fun, all while making it easy for anyone to participate.</p>
            <p>We are launching on Pump.fun, a platform designed for seamless token swaps and liquidity, which allows us to empower our users and reward community-driven growth. With a supply of 1 billion coins, TurboTurtle Coin is poised to be the next big meme coin, combining the strength of our community and the speed of the crypto space.</p>

            <h2>2. The Problem</h2>
            <p>The crypto world is saturated with tokens and meme coins, many of which have no clear use case or long-term value. While meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have gained popularity, the market is still missing an engaging, truly community-driven token that combines fun with utility. Most of these coins are built without a real vision or commitment to a decentralized, engaged community.</p>

            <h2>3. The Solution: TurboTurtle Coin</h2>
            <p>TurboTurtle Coin aims to solve this by bringing together the best elements of meme coins with a robust and community-first ecosystem. TurboTurtle is a token that values the community above all. Our goal is to provide a platform where the users are in control. Through Pump.fun, a trusted platform in the DeFi space, TurboTurtle Coin will be available for buying, swapping, and liquidity staking.</p>
            <p>Unlike other meme coins, TurboTurtle is built with a minimalist approach to ownership. The developers, including our small team, will only hold 0.1% of the total token supply. This ensures that the community is the true driving force of TurboTurtle's success.</p>

            <h2>4. Tokenomics</h2>
            <p>TurboTurtle Coin will have a total supply of 1 billion tokens, with the following distribution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>50% to Community: This portion will be used to incentivize community participation, including staking rewards, airdrops, and liquidity pools.</li>
                <li>30% to Public Sale & Partnerships: Tokens available for initial and ongoing public sales, as well as strategic partnerships that help grow the ecosystem.</li>
                <li>10% for Development: This portion will fund the development of the project, including marketing, infrastructure, and future innovations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project's team will hold just 0.1% of the total supply to ensure the true decentralized nature of TurboTurtle.</p>

            <h2>5. How to Buy TurboTurtle Coin</h2>
            <p>TurboTurtle Coin will be available for purchase and trade through the Pump.fun platform, as well as major decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap.</p>
            <p>To buy TurboTurtle Coin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Install a cryptocurrency wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet.</li>
                <li>Connect your wallet to Pump.fun.</li>
                <li>Swap your ETH (or other tokens) for TurboTurtle Coin directly on the platform.</li>
            </ul>
